# Understanding React Context: A Complete Guide

React Context is a powerful feature that allows you to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. It's particularly useful for sharing global data like themes, user authentication, or language preferences.

## What is React Context?

Context provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing a prop through every level of the tree. Think of it as a way to broadcast data to all descendant components that need it.

## When to Use Context?

Context is ideal for:

- Theme data
- User authentication state
- Language preferences
- Global UI state
- Any data that needs to be accessed by many components
